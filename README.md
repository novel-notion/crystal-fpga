# crystal-fpga
The Crystal Board is an FPGA platform based on the Adafruit Feather form factor with a Lattice Crosslink FPGA at its heart. The goal of this project is to create a useful and afforadable FPGA hardware platform targeted at students, makers and hackers. Finally.

## Requirements
The Crystal Board strives to succeed in key areas where other FPGA development boards often fall short. In other words, the Crystal Board shall be:

- affordable for highschool and undergraduate students
- supported by a freely available and user-friendly toolchain and workflow
- compatible with commonly available hobbyist hardware, (breadboards, jumper wires, 0.1" header, Feather Wings)
- capable enough to create non-trivial digital logic designs without compromise and without overburden.

There are many excellent hobbyist level FPGA projects out there, but there is always room for improvement. 


## Specifications (the good stuff)
Guided by the above requirments, the Crystal Board provides the following specifications. 

- Affordability 
    - $50 dollar price point, dropping with quantity.
    - Published Gerbers and no BGAs i.e. further cost savings for the brave hand-solderers 
- Software/Workflow
    - Crosslink FPGAs use the Lattice Radiant IDE, a modern and gorgeous GUI-based software.
    - Radiant IDE available for Windows and Linux, Free license available.
    - Budding support for Open Source workflow via Project Oxide.
- Form Factor and Compatibility 
    - Fully compatible with the 90+ Feather Wings in the Adafruit Feather ecosystem
    - 1x PMOD, 6x Buttons, 4x LEDs, ~25 digital IO.
    - 3x Analog sense channels 
    - Drag-and-Drop programming, USB serial port, JTAG
- FPGA Resources
    - LIFCL-17 gives great cost to performance ratio 
    - 17k LE, 2Mb BRAM, 24x 18x18 Multipliers, 2 PLLs
    - Upgrade path to 39k LE device
